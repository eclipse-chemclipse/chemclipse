# Chemclipse

The Eclipse Chemclipse project offers functionality for data reading and processing in the domain of Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics. Specifically, workflows for chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), flame-ionization detectors (GC/FID), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are implemented.

[Chemclipse](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science.chemclipse) is part of the [Eclipse Science](https://science.eclipse.org/) working group and is the basis for [OpenChromÂ®](https://github.com/Openchrom/openchrom).

For user- and developer documentation, have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/eclipse/chemclipse/wiki).
